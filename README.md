# Credits

This boilerplate is heavily based on [Yannick Wittner](https://github.com/wityan)'s Next.js Boilerplate: https://github.com/wityan/next-js-boilerplate. We only adjusted it to fit our needs.

Make sure you also read his medium article, if you are interested in the backgrounds of this architecture: https://wityan.medium.com/next-js-project-structure-1531610bed71.

# Installation

Next.js requires [Node.js 12.0]([nodejs.org/](ttps://nodejs.org/en/download/)) or later as system requirement. This Boilerplate uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) as it's package manager. Make sure you have installed both requirements.

Clone the repository and change the directory of your terminal to the downloaded folder.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Infotition/next.js-boilerplate.git
$ cd next.js-boilerplate
```

Install all packages using the `npm install` command.
```bash
$ npm install
```

Now everything should be working fine. If you have any problems, don't hesitate to join our official [discord server](https://discord.gg/NpxrDGYDwV).
